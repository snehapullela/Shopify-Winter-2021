# Shopify-Winter-2021
Hello,

The folder Shopify consists of 4 files. One is the dataset that has been used for doing the analysis. The second file is the text file which consists of the SQL statements for question number 2 in the challenge. The third file is a screenshot that I have used in the jupyter notebook.
The fourth file is a jupyter notebook which consists of all the code that has been written in order to do the analysis.

Thank you, <br/>
Sneha Pullela
